UFO-Sightings Searchable Website

The purpose of this project was to code a web site that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided by the client in a static data.js for now. It is designed to allow the client’s users to filter the table data for specific values. The restrictions imposed by the client based on their system capabilities were that we could only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on their web pages. The client believes these, “are the only coding languages which can be trusted”. This did not prevent the project from accomplishing its goal. 

The next iteration will be to connect the web page to the client’s database for dynamic updating and user access to the depth of information the client has curated.
